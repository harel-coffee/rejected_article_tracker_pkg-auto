abstract = {Background: The fate of papers submitted and subsequently rejected by the British Journal of Surgery (BJS) is currently unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether, when and where these papers are published following rejection. Methods: All rejected manuscripts in the year 2006 were identified from the Manuscript Central electronic database. Between December 2008 and February 2009, a PubMed search was conducted spanning the period 2006-2009 using the corresponding author's last name and initials to identify whether and when manuscripts had been published elsewhere. Results: From the 926 manuscripts rejected by BJS, 609 (65-8 per cent) were published in 198 different journals with a mean(s.d.) time lapse of 13-8(6-5) months. Some 165 manuscripts (27-1 per cent) were published in general surgical journals, 250 (41-1 per cent) in subspecialty surgical journals and 194 (31-9 per cent) in non-surgical journals. The mean(s.d.) impact factor of the journals was 2-0(1-1). Only 14 manuscripts (2-3 per cent) were published in journals with a higher impact factor than that of BJS. Conclusion: Rejection of a manuscript by BJS does not preclude publication, but rejected manuscripts are published more often in surgical subspecialty journals and journals with a lower impact factor, although the occasional exception exists.

@article{Donovan2007,
abstract = {If your research paper is rejected for publication by a peer-reviewed journal, what do you do next? Some editors would suggest that it should not be sent to another journal, yet there are contributors who would just put a failed' paper straight back in the mail to another journal and trust to luck. I argue that rejection should be a time for reassessment, when the input of the editor(s) and reviewers(s), all experts in their fleld, should be considered and acted upon as necessary. The revitalized and improved contribution can then be sent to a new journal with confidence.},

    abstract = { Retractions of scientific articles are becoming the most relevant institution for making sense of scientific misconduct. An increasing number of retracted articles, mainly attributed to misconduct, is currently providing a new empirical basis for research about scientific misconduct. This article reviews the relevant research literature from an interdisciplinary context. Furthermore, the results from these studies are contextualized sociologically by asking how scientific misconduct is made visible through retractions. This study treats retractions as an emerging institution that renders scientific misconduct visible, thus, following up on the sociology of deviance and its focus on visibility. The article shows that retractions, by highlighting individual cases of misconduct and general policies for preventing misconduct while obscuring the actors and processes through which retractions are effected, produce highly fragmented patterns of visibility. These patterns resemble the bifurcation in current justice systems. }

    abstract = "{Duplicate and salami publication are unethical, but are common practices with substantial consequences for science and society at large. Scientific journals are the ‘gatekeepers’ of the publication process. We investigated journal policies on duplicate and salami publication.In 2018, we performed a content analysis of policies of journals in the disciplines of ‘epidemiology and public health’ and ‘general and internal medicine’. Journal policies were searched, extracted, coded and cross-checked. The associations of disciplinary categories and journal impact factors with journal policies were examined using Poisson regression models with a robust error variance.A total of 209 journals, including 122 in epidemiology and public health and 87 in general and internal medicine, were sampled and their policies investigated. Overall, 18\\% of journals did not have any policies on either practice, 33\\% only referred to a generic guideline or checklist without explicit mention about either practice, 36\\% included policies on duplicate publication and only 13\\% included policies on both duplicate and salami publication. Having explicit journal policies did not differ by journal disciplinary categories (epidemiology and public health vs general and internal medicine) or impact factors. Further analysis of journals with explicit policies found that although duplicate publication is universally discouraged, policies on salami publication are inconsistent and lack specific definitions of inappropriate divisions of papers.Gaps exist in journal policies on duplicate and salami publication, characterized by an overall lack of explicit policies, inconsistency and confusion in definitions of bad practices, and lack of clearly defined consequences for non-compliance. Scientific publication and the academic reward systems must evolve to credit good research practice.}",
